        <p class="lead mb-4">My current professional experience includes working as a barista and cashier at a boba shop called Gong Cha in my hometown of San Jose California. I worked at this location for over a year starting in May 2021 until September 2022. At this job, I was quickly promoted after a few months to a Shift Lead. My responsibilities included supervising a team of 5 workers to run the store efficiently, mentoring new workers, teaching new employees to make different teas and toppings, overseeing in-store execution of sales and promotions, ensuring the establishment's safety by strictly following food and service standards and procedures, and communicating with customers when issues arise.
<br><br>

        Besides my experience working at Gong Cha, I have leadership experience in various extracurriculars in high school including the Vietnamese Student Association and Associated Student Body. I was president of my high schoolâ€™s Vietnamese Student Association and my responsibilities included curating community spaces for members through general meetings, bondings, and game nights. I also oversaw a cultural show with a turnout of 400+ alongside a team of officers in order to share Vietnamese culture and coordinated fundraisers and helped raise over $2000. In my high schoolâ€™s Associated Study Body, I was the class treasurer my junior year and club commissioner my senior year. As club commissioner, I managed over 60 clubs and organizations on campus, planned school-wide events for over 2000 students like Club Day and school rallies, and maintained and updated Club Website which has had 700+ views. 
<br><br>

Apart from my work experience and my extracurricular activities, I have participated in various leadership programs or workshops. In 2022, over the summer, I attended the Asian Pacific American Congressional Studies (APACIS) leadership academy. This was a week-long program that took place in Washington DC, that consisted of various leadership workshops, tours of the nationâ€™s capital, and panels of workers in the government. I had the opportunity to speak to interns and workers from all three branches of the government from the legislative, judicial, and even executive where I received the opportunity to get a tour of the white house.
